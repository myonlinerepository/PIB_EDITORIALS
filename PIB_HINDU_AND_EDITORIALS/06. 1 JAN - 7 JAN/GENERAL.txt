N: Auction for sale of government stocks
U: http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=175098
CATEGORY: FACTS-PRELIMS

QUESTION 1. What is the difference between price based auction and yield based auction (of government securities) ?

ANSWER: 
Whenever a company (private/public) goes public, the process of IPO has the following sequence:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Appoint a merchant banker: In case of a large public issue, the company can appoint more than 1 merchant banker [The job of a merchant banker is to assist the company with various aspects of the IPO process ]
	2. Apply to SEBI with a registration statement: The registration statement contains details on what the company does, why the company plans to go public and the financial health of the company
	3. Getting a nod from SEBI:  Once SEBI receives the registration statement, SEBI takes a call on whether to issue a go ahead or a ‘no go’ to the IPO
	4. DRHP: If the company gets the initial SEBI nod, then the company needs to prepare the DRHP. A DRHP is a document that gets circulated to the public. Along with a lot of information, DRHP should contain the following details [The estimated size of the IPO, The estimated number of shares being offered to public, Business description including the revenue model, expenditure details, Management Discussion, details and Analysis,Risks involved in the business, etc] [DRHP - draft red herring prospectus]
	5. Market the IPO: TV and print advertisements in order to build awareness 
	6. Fix the price band: Decide the price band between which the company would like to go public [Max - Min price fixed by company under SEBI regulations for the IPO ]
	7. Book Building: 
	 - official opening of the window during which the public can subscribe for shares.
	 - For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.120, then the public can actually choose a price they think is fair enough for the IPO issue.
	 -The process of collecting all these price points along with the respective quantities is called Book Building. 
	 - Book building is perceived as an effective price discovery method [price point would be estimated on a weighted average basis]
	8. Closure:  The price point at which the issue gets listed is decided. This price point is usually that price at which maximum bids have been received.
	9. Listing Day: This is the day when the company actually gets listed on the stock exchange

	Yield Based Auction: 
	--------------------
		1. Just like a company that goes public has to go through point no. 7, when the governemnt auctions its new securities, it has to figure out what is the most anticipated and best yield with which it can issue its security.
		2. Investors bid in yield terms up to two decimal places (for example, 8.19 per cent, 8.20 per cent, etc.)
		3. Bids are arranged in ascending order and the cut-off yield is arrived at the yield corresponding to the notified amount of the auction
		4. successful bidders are those who have bid at or below the cut-off yield. Bids which are higher than the cut-off yield are rejected.

	Price Based Auction:
	--------------------
		1. A price based auction is conducted when Government of India re-issues securities issued earlier
		2. Bidders quote in terms of price per Rs.100 of face value of the security (e.g., Rs.102.00, Rs.101.00, Rs.100.00, Rs.99.00, etc., per Rs.100/-).
		3. Bids are arranged in descending order and the successful bidders are those who have bid at or above the cut-off price
		4. Bids which are below the cut-off price are rejected.

QUESTION 2: Name of RBI's Core Banking solution? 
ANSWER: E-Kuber. Core banking functions will include transaction accounts, loans, mortgages and payments. Banks make these services available across multiple channels like automated teller machines, Internet banking, mobile banking and branches.

CATEGORY: FACTS-PRELIMS

In a reply to a question on innovative solutions taken by the Government to cut urea consumption, in Lok Sabha today:
Objective ? To encourage balanced use of fertilizers
Steps taken? 
- Made it mandatory for all the domestic producers of urea to produce 100% as Neem Coated Urea [both indigenously produced urea and imported urea ]
- introduction of 45 Kg bag of urea in place of existing 50 Kg bags [Since farmers use urea interms of number of bags instead of the actual quantity] - thereby bringing down consumption by 10%.

=> This is gonna further help the government to reduce its revenue expenditure in terms of subsidies and can invest more on capex.

Kingdom of Lesotho
-------------------
1. It is an enclaved country [just like San Marino within Italy, Vatican City within the city of Rome, Italy ] within south africa.
2. Swaziland that is also like Lesotho [partial enclave within south africa] shares borders with Mozambique.

Also Note: 
-----------
A true enclave is the one that cannot be reached without passing through the territory of a single other state that surrounds it. 
A historical example was West Berlin before the reunification of Germany. Since 1945, all of Berlin was ruled de jure by the four Allied powers.
However, the East German government and the Soviet Union treated East Berlin as an integral part of East Germany, so West Berlin was a de facto enclave within East Germany. 
Also, 12 small West Berlin enclaves, such as Steinstücken, were separated from the city, some by only a few meters

About S.N.Bose's Work:
----------------------
The most regarded work of S.N. Bose is Bose Statistics, Bose Einstein Condensation and Higgs Boson.

Boson Group in Standard Model of Physics
-----------------------------------------
- The standard model of physics gives us details about how the basic particles interact with each other at the sub-atomic level guided by 4 fundamental forces.
- Three of the fundamental forces result from the exchange of force-carrier particles [Field quanta], which belong to a broader group called “bosons”
- Particles of matter transfer discrete amounts of energy by exchanging bosons with each other.
- Each fundamental force has its own corresponding boson – 
	= the strong force is carried by the “gluon”
	= the electromagnetic force is carried by the “photon”
	= the “W and Z bosons” are responsible for the weak force
	= although not yet found, the “graviton” should be the corresponding force-carrying particle of gravity
    = Higgs boson, recently discovered, is the particle that gives matter its mass.

   http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=154604
   
CATEGORY: FACTS-PRELIMS

Basic Objectives?
------------------
The Project entails development of fairway with 3 meters depth between Varanasi and Haldia (Phase-I) by capacity augmentation of navigation on National Waterway-1 + Multi Modal Terminal Development + Inter Modal Development + Navigational Lock Development + Navigational Aid + RoRo Services + Integrated Ship Repair and Maintenance complexes + River Information System (RIS) and Vessel Traffic   Management System and other Bank Protection works

What is that capacity augumentation of navigation that is being emphasisez on ?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- One of the major problems for a commercially viable and safe navigation on NW-1 is low depth upstream of Farakka (site along ganges) due to low discharges from tributaries and difficult hydro morphological characteristics of river Ganga.
- So, upgrading and creating new navigational lock is the way forward to solve this issue.

What is a Navigational Lock ?
-----------------------------
- A navigational lock is a device used for raising and lowering ships/vessels between stretches of water of different levels on river and canal waterways
- The existing lock in Farakka is outdated and repairing them will stall the navigation for about 8 months.
- So, it has been planned to construct a new one [which will reduce the navigation duration from the existing 2 hours to 38 minutes]
- And then subsequently upgrade the outdated navigational lock.

Who funds ?
-----------
- Govt. of India + World Bank (IBRD) + Private Players (PPP Model)

Implementing Ministry ? 
------------------------
- Ministry of Shipping [Under Inland Waterways Authority of Inida]

Different Components in the project?
-------------------------------
- Multimodal terminal at Varanasi; Multimodal terminal at Sahibganj; New navigation lock at Farakka

What are the impacts of this implementation ?
----------------------------------------------
- Alternative mode of transport (environment friendly and cost effective).
- The project will contribute in bringing down the logistics cost in the country.

CATEGORY: FACTS-PRELIMS

What is Bio-Diesel ?
----------------------
- Biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils, yellow grease, used cooking oils, or animal fats. The production process, called esterification, converts oils or fats into chemicals called long-chain mono alkyl esters.
- Bio-Diesel is environment friendly fuel & is meant to be used in standard diesel engines.
- It can be blended in terms of "B" factor to state the amount of biodiesel in any fuel mix [in the different blending ratio such as B5, B10, B20, B50 and B 100; Ex:B5->(5% biodiesel, 95% petroleum diesel)]

N: Major reasons for underground burning / firing of coal ?
U: http://pib.nic.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1515277
CATEGORY: FACTS-PRELIMS / STATIC / SCI-TECH

Major reason of fire in underground coal mines ?
------------------------------------------------

- It happens coz of spontaneous combustion of coal which is the process of self-heating of coal when exposed to air [oxidation of minerals in the exposed coal]
- Certain varieties of coal contain minerals that heat up when they are exposed to oxygen; those minerals can in turn burst into flames.
- If the rate of dissipation of heat is relatively slow as compared to the progress of heat by oxidation, there is a gradual build-up of heat and coal bed temperature reaches to the ignition point of coal thereby causing fire.
-  Such fire can be prevented by nitrogen flushing in fire affected areas and use of quick setting materials for construction of isolation stopping.

Any major incidents that had happened in India?

Also so a comprehensive study on the historical underpinnings of coal from stratfor [from an angle of economic dependency & geopolitics]

Why does Indian coal has higher Ash content than other areas in the world?
Indian Coal has comparatively higher ash content than imported coal due to drift theory of formation of coal deposits in India. Coal seams formed due to drift theory contains higher ash as compared to in-situ theory of formation.  [http://pib.nic.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1515278]

   http://www.tropmet.res.in/monsoon/files/about_us.php
CATEGORY: FACTS-PRELIMS / MAINS-ANALYSIS

- Implemented under the aegis of "Ministry of Earth Sciences"

What is National Monsoon Mission ?
-----------------------------------
Monsoon being the lifeline of India, influencing agriculture yield, economy, water resources, power generation and ecosystem; if the variations in monsoon rainfall are known well in advance, it would be possible to reduce the adverse impacts
- So, the ministry has planned to develope a state-of-the-art dynamical prediction system for monsoon rainfall on different time scales & MoES has bestowed the responsibility of execution and coordination of this mission to the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune
- Climate Forecast System (CFS) of NCEP, USA has been identified as the basic modelling system for the above purpose, as it is one of the best among the currently available coupled models [Ocean-Atmospheric coupling]

Why is there a need for NMM anyway?
------------------------------------
-El Nino and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) being a dominant mode of global inter-annual variability and due to its vast influence on other regional climates, in last few decades researchers have made large number of studies on the ENSO phenomena and its various impacts using atmospheric and ocean-atmosphere coupled general circulation models
-In recent decades, dynamical numerical models have considerably improved and most of the global coupled models have shown good prediction skill of ENSO SST with six months lead time

Practical Uses?
---------------
IMD in collaboration with ICAR issues guidelines/advisories to the farmers during the sowing season.
These advisories are used for critical farm operations Viz. 
(i) Management of sowing (Delayed onset of rains); 
(ii) Changing crop variety (Delay in rainfall); 
(iii) Spraying Pesticides for disease control (occurrence of rainfall); 
(iv) Managing Irrigation (Heavy rainfall Forecast).
(V) India Meteorological Department (IMD) provides meteorological support to the Central Water Commission (CWC) for issuing flood warning

Now, who is creating this state-of-the-art coupled ocean atmospheric model ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, +
- Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), +
- Hyderabad and National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), NOIDA
