N: Auction for sale of government stocks
U: http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=175098
CATEGORY: FACTS-PRELIMS

QUESTION 1. What is the difference between price based auction and yield based auction (of government securities) ?

ANSWER: 
Whenever a company (private/public) goes public, the process of IPO has the following sequence:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Appoint a merchant banker: In case of a large public issue, the company can appoint more than 1 merchant banker [The job of a merchant banker is to assist the company with various aspects of the IPO process ]
	2. Apply to SEBI with a registration statement: The registration statement contains details on what the company does, why the company plans to go public and the financial health of the company
	3. Getting a nod from SEBI:  Once SEBI receives the registration statement, SEBI takes a call on whether to issue a go ahead or a ‘no go’ to the IPO
	4. DRHP: If the company gets the initial SEBI nod, then the company needs to prepare the DRHP. A DRHP is a document that gets circulated to the public. Along with a lot of information, DRHP should contain the following details [The estimated size of the IPO, The estimated number of shares being offered to public, Business description including the revenue model, expenditure details, Management Discussion, details and Analysis,Risks involved in the business, etc] [DRHP - draft red herring prospectus]
	5. Market the IPO: TV and print advertisements in order to build awareness 
	6. Fix the price band: Decide the price band between which the company would like to go public [Max - Min price fixed by company under SEBI regulations for the IPO ]
	7. Book Building: 
	 - official opening of the window during which the public can subscribe for shares.
	 - For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.120, then the public can actually choose a price they think is fair enough for the IPO issue.
	 -The process of collecting all these price points along with the respective quantities is called Book Building. 
	 - Book building is perceived as an effective price discovery method [price point would be estimated on a weighted average basis]
	8. Closure:  The price point at which the issue gets listed is decided. This price point is usually that price at which maximum bids have been received.
	9. Listing Day: This is the day when the company actually gets listed on the stock exchange

	Yield Based Auction: 
	--------------------
		1. Just like a company that goes public has to go through point no. 7, when the governemnt auctions its new securities, it has to figure out what is the most anticipated and best yield with which it can issue its security.
		2. Investors bid in yield terms up to two decimal places (for example, 8.19 per cent, 8.20 per cent, etc.)
		3. Bids are arranged in ascending order and the cut-off yield is arrived at the yield corresponding to the notified amount of the auction
		4. successful bidders are those who have bid at or below the cut-off yield. Bids which are higher than the cut-off yield are rejected.

	Price Based Auction:
	--------------------
		1. A price based auction is conducted when Government of India re-issues securities issued earlier
		2. Bidders quote in terms of price per Rs.100 of face value of the security (e.g., Rs.102.00, Rs.101.00, Rs.100.00, Rs.99.00, etc., per Rs.100/-).
		3. Bids are arranged in descending order and the successful bidders are those who have bid at or above the cut-off price
		4. Bids which are below the cut-off price are rejected.

QUESTION 2: Name of RBI's Core Banking solution? 
ANSWER: E-Kuber. Core banking functions will include transaction accounts, loans, mortgages and payments. Banks make these services available across multiple channels like automated teller machines, Internet banking, mobile banking and branches.

N: Availability of Urea in 45 Kg bags instead of 50 Kg bags may bring down consumption of Urea by 10% : AGRO Ministry
U: http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=175108
CATEGORY: FACTS-PRELIMS

In a reply to a question on innovative solutions taken by the Government to cut urea consumption, in Lok Sabha today:
Objective ? To encourage balanced use of fertilizers
Steps taken? 
- Made it mandatory for all the domestic producers of urea to produce 100% as Neem Coated Urea [both indigenously produced urea and imported urea ]
- introduction of 45 Kg bag of urea in place of existing 50 Kg bags [Since farmers use urea interms of number of bags instead of the actual quantity] - thereby bringing down consumption by 10%.

=> This is gonna further help the government to reduce its revenue expenditure in terms of subsidies and can invest more on capex.

N: King & Queesn of Lesotho calls on President
U: http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=175109
CATEGORY : FACTS-PRELIMS

Kingdom of Lesotho
-------------------
1. It is an enclaved country [just like San Marino within Italy, Vatican City within the city of Rome, Italy ] within south africa.
2. Swaziland that is also like Lesotho [partial enclave within south africa] shares borders with Mozambique.

Also Note: 
-----------
A true enclave is the one that cannot be reached without passing through the territory of a single other state that surrounds it. 
A historical example was West Berlin before the reunification of Germany. Since 1945, all of Berlin was ruled de jure by the four Allied powers.
However, the East German government and the Soviet Union treated East Berlin as an integral part of East Germany, so West Berlin was a de facto enclave within East Germany. 
Also, 12 small West Berlin enclaves, such as Steinstücken, were separated from the city, some by only a few meters

About S.N.Bose's Work:
----------------------
The most regarded work of S.N. Bose is Bose Statistics, Bose Einstein Condensation and Higgs Boson.

Boson Group in Standard Model of Physics
-----------------------------------------
- The standard model of physics gives us details about how the basic particles interact with each other at the sub-atomic level guided by 4 fundamental forces.
- Three of the fundamental forces result from the exchange of force-carrier particles [Field quanta], which belong to a broader group called “bosons”
- Particles of matter transfer discrete amounts of energy by exchanging bosons with each other.
- Each fundamental force has its own corresponding boson – 
	= the strong force is carried by the “gluon”
	= the electromagnetic force is carried by the “photon”
	= the “W and Z bosons” are responsible for the weak force
	= although not yet found, the “graviton” should be the corresponding force-carrying particle of gravity
    = Higgs boson, recently discovered, is the particle that gives matter its mass.


What is Genomics?
Genomics is an interdisciplinary field of science focusing on the structure, function, evolution, mapping, and editing of genomes
