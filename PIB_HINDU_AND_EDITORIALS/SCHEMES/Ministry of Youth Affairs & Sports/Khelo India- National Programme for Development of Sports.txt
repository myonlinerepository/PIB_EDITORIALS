At present, promotion and development of sports in the country is being carried out through following three schemes:
I.   Rajiv Gandhi Khel Abhiyan      - To provide infrastructure in rural areas and to encourage sporting culture in the country through competitions.
II.  Urban Infrastructure Scheme    - To provide quality sports infrastructure in urban areas so as to provide facilities for talent to hone their skills.
III. National Sports Talent Search  – To identify young talent.

To promote mass participation in sports and achieve effective implementation, the existing schemes of Rajiv Gandhi Khel Abhiyan (RGKA), Urban Sports Infrastructure Scheme (USIS) and National Sports Talent Search Scheme (NSTSS) are proposed to be dovetailed into a single scheme to be named as “Khelo India: National Programme for Development of Sports

The department has restructured the scheme from a Centrally Sponsored Scheme into a Central Sector Scheme.
