N: IT Minister launches first NIC CERT to prevent & predict cyber attacks on government utilities 
U: http://pib.nic.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1512186
CATEGORY: HIGH

- As the world is moving towards digital and Indian govt. is also pushing for Digital initiatives, the threat that comes from cyber attack is increasing manifold.
- To counter this threat, the govt did the following :
   i)  Drafting the Data protection Act.
   ii) NIC-CERT

- NIC-CERT has been setup with the objective of creating a comprehensive framework that integrates world class security components and inbuilt threat intelligence for detection, prevention and incident response. Using the tools the team will correlate events that would help in generating a canvas of the attack surface and identify the vulnerabilities and possible exploits. The gathered intelligence assimilated with the knowledge of the open web would give the CERT the ability prevent and predict attacks.

CATEGORY: MAINS-ANALYSIS
Also refer : BigPicture debade on : Importance of Legislatures.

1. Inefficient working of legislatures, erodes the confidence in parliamentary democracy at the grass root level.
2. Agencies that aid in the effective functioning of Parliament : Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committees and other Committees (Suggestion is to make it more representative - from all sections of political parties and should make its recommendations binding on the govt - currently advisory role only, it need not appear in the draft bill)
3. These Committees have the power to summon senior officers of the Government and others concerned for obtaining evidence and information on related matters and work almost 24x7 all round the year.
4.The Rules of Business of the House must be strengthened, to avoid frequent disruptions.

10 Points made by VP for effective functioning of the house:
-------------------------------------------------------------
i) Measuring the productivity of the Legislature:
- scientific measurement of the effectiveness and productivity of legislature based on the number of sittings, bills passed, bills held up, members’ participation, duration of debate on each bill, quality of debates and range of issues of public interest debated, extent of disruptions, reports of Committees submitted.

ii) Ranking of Legislatures of the country
- All the legislatures of the country can also be similarly ranked and making these rankings public would bring public pressure on the respective legislatures, governments and even the political concerned.

iii) Quorum for Opposition Members
Quorum should be made binding on all the political parties (ruling, opposition, etc )

iv) Notifying disruptions
legislatures may display the names of such members in public domain with an observation that they have violated the rules in disregard of the directions of the Chair and there by adversely impacting the functioning of the House.

v) Automatic suspension of members
a specific provision in the Rules of Business for automatic suspension of members who rushes to the well of the House

5. India is firm that any Ministerial Declaration must reaffirm the principles of the multilateral trading system, the completion of the Doha Development Agenda, the centrality of development and the availability of special and differential treatment and other concerns of developing countries

1. National Center for Seismology, Ministry of Earth Sciences is nodal agency of Government of India dealing with various activities in the field of seismology and allied disciplines

2. Classification
--------------
Zone 5
------
- Zone 5 covers the areas with the highest risks zone that suffers earthquakes 
- It is referred to as the Very High Damage Risk Zone.
- Generally, the areas having trap rock or basaltic rock are prone to earthquakes.
- The region of Kashmir, the Western and Central Himalayas, North and Middle Bihar, the North-East Indian region, the Rann of Kutch and the Andaman and Nicobar group of islands fall in this zone.

Zone 4 : This zone is called the High Damage Risk Zone 
Zone 3 : This zone is classified as Moderate Damage Risk Zone 
Zone 2 : This zone is classified as the Low Damage Risk Zone
Zone 1 : Since the current division of India into earthquake hazard zones does not use Zone 1, no area of India is classed as Zone 1.

SFDRR

CATEGORY :FACTS-PRELIMSs

- National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) chaired by the Cabinet secretary, Shri P K Sinha met on 04th December and reviewed the relief and rescue operations in States and Union Territories affected by the cyclone

Cyclone Ockhi
-------------
1. Unlike the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea rarely generates severe cyclones.
2. In a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change reported that the Arabian Sea would throw up more number of deadly storms with wind speeds of 165 km/hr or more [They blamed global warming for this]
3. Two factors have contributed to the increased severity of Arabian Sea cyclones
 - First, the Arabian Sea surface becomes warmer than the other ocean basins during this period.
 - Second, and more important, due to the interplay of global warming, climate variability and weather changes, winter monsoon circulation has been weakening over the years.

 Also, they mentioned "After the monsoon season, the vertical shear — changing winds from the surface to the upper atmosphere which tends to remove energy from the cyclone and prevents their strengthening — gets reduced, making cyclone formation more probable"

Why Ockhi?
Ever wondered why cyclones are given names? The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) started the tropical cyclone naming system in 2000.

The name Ockhi was given by Bangladesh which in Bengali means ‘eye’. The previous storm that hit northeastern India was called Mora. Find more on naming cyclones
