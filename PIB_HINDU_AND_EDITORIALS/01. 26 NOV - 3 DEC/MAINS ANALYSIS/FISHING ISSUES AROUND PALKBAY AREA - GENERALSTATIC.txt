Background
------------
Based on UNCLOS, both India and Srilanka agreed to demarcate the International Maritime Boundary Line in 1974 and in 1976 and the fishermen are allowed to venture till their respective EEZs.

BILATERAL ISSUE ?
------------------
- Given the proximity of the two countries in the sea, the incidents of straying of fishermen and crossing the IMBL are common.
- The major concerns expressed by Sri Lankan side is to seek for a ban on bottom trawling or other destructive fishing methods, which cause harm to the marine environment and biodiversity in the Palk Bay.
- To ensure availability of natural resources to future generation while meeting the livelihood needs of the present
- Palkbay is one of the biodiversity hotspots listed under UNESCO's Man and biodiversity program

What is the issue with bottom trawling?
---------------------------------------
- It involves trawlers dragging weighted nets along the sea-floor, causing great depletion of aquatic resources. 
- Bottom trawling captures juvenile fish, thus exhausting the ocean’s resources and affecting marine conservation efforts [ Also, causes extensive damage to coral reefs in that region ]

India’s deep-sea fishing plan ?
---------------------------------
- The solution to bottom trawling issue lies in transition from trawling to deep-sea fishing.  
- The activity of catching fish that live in the deep parts of the sea/ocean is called deep-sea fishing which causes is less ecological damage.
- Government of India is considering the modalities for implementation of a Scheme, in which it is proposed to incentivize the traditional fishermen for Deep- Sea Fishing
- A ‘Special Package’ is being considered for encouraging the fishermen of Tamil Nadu to undertake deep sea fishing by diversifying their bottom trawlers into Tuna long liners
construction of fishing harbours is carried out at Rameshwaram, Ennore and at Mukaiyur.
- The time period for this transition is three years (2017-2020).

What are the concerns raised by many?
-------------------------------------
- There is a need of clarity on sufficient stocks of fish in the adjacent waters of the Bay of Bengal and Gulf of Mannar to make deep sea fishing economically viable
- There is a need of clarity on sufficient stocks of fish in the adjacent waters of the Bay of Bengal and Gulf of Mannar to make deep sea fishing economically viable for a large and new fleet of vessels
- The Indian government report of the Working Group for Revalidating the Potential of Fishery Resources in the Indian EEZ suggests that oceanic regions have a maximum potential yield of 208,000 tonnes. 
- However, it does not state where the remaining oceanic stocks exist.
- Moreover, the report warns that oceanic resources are transboundary and hence are targeted by a number of other countries too.
- Limited skills of fishermen and their interest for deep sea fishing is a cause of concern.
- Doubts about the high operational costs of deep sea fishing and the loan repayment schedule imposed by the Bank
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: The government is now creating a new deep sea fishing harbour at Mookaiyur, located just south of the Palk Bay in the Gulf of Mannar, where many of these vessels are likely to be berthed

Update: 
--------

- The Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries (DADF), Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare has introduced a new Sub-component namely “Assistance for Deep Sea Fishing” under the Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS) on Blue Revolution Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries
- the traditional fishermen and their societies / associations can avail financial assistance to the extent of Rs. 40 lakh per vessel for purchase of deep sea fishing vessel including equipments to increase fish production [50% subsidy provided by Union, remaining has to be given by States/UTs]
- Training programmes on tuna long lining, onboard handling and processing of fish with the financial assistance of DADF is also being imparted by the DADF through the organizations like Central Institute of Fisheries Nautical Engineering & Training (CIFNET) and Fishery Survey of India (FSI).
