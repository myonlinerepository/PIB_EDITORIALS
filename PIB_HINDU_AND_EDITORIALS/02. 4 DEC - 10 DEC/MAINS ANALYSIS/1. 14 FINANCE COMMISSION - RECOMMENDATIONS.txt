***********************************
Key Areas of Concern : Devolution of Taxes; Fiscal centralization and fiscal decentralization at the same time (GST + 14th FC recommendation ); cooperative federalism;
***********************************
14th FC Recommendations
------------------------
1.  Sharing of Union Taxes :
Increasing the share of tax devolution to 42 per cent of the divisible pool would serve the twin objectives of increasing the flow of unconditional transfers to the States and yet leave appropriate fiscal space for the Union to carry out specific purpose transfers to the States
[Vertical tax devolution: The Union-State devolution; Horizontal tax devolution - Tax devolution among states]

2. Local Governments
i) Local bodies should be required to spend the grants only on the basic services within the functions assigned to them under relevant legislations
ii) Distribution of grants to the States ; METHOD >> 2011 population data with weight of 90 per cent and area with weight of 10 per cent
iii)  The grant to each state will be divided into two: 
      [ To duly constituted Gram panchayats +  To duly constituted Municipalities ]
iv) The grants to be divided in two parts - a basic grant and a performance grant [ Panchayat ( Basic-90%, Perfomance-10% ) & Municipalities ( Basic - 80%, Perfomance - 20% ) ]
v) The grants should go directly to panchayats which are responsible for the delivery of basic services, without any share for other levels using the formula given by the recent SFC.
vi) Similarly, the basic grant for urban local bodies will be divided into tier-wise shares (Municipal corporations, Municipalities, Nagar panchayats using the formula given by the respective SFCs)
vii) Performance grants are being provided to address the following issues: 
	(i) making available reliable data on local bodies' receipt and expenditure through audited accounts; and 
	(ii) improvement in own revenues.

Other key recommendations of FFC
---------------------------------
1. Eight Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) delinked from support from the Centre [ flexibility to implement delinked CSS schemes as per local needs by states - Moving away from 'One size fits all' approach]
2. Revenue compensation to States under GST should be for five years; 100% in first three years, 75% in fourth year and 50% in fifth year.
3. Create an autonomous and independent ‘GST Compensation Fund’ through legislative actions to facilitate compensations.
4. Suggesting a fiscal consolidation roadmap, FFC puts a ceiling on fiscal deficit at 3% of GDP from 2016-17 onwards
5. Establish an independent Fiscal Council to undertake ex-ante assessment of fiscal policy implications of budget proposals and their consistency with fiscal policy and rules
6. Several recommendations made for evaluating government’s ownership, disinvestment in Central Public Sector Enterprises
7. Suitably amend Electricity Act 2003 to facilitate levy of penalties for delays in payment of subsidies by the State Governments
8. Have independent regulators for road sector for tariff setting, quality regulation, among other functions.

TAKEAWAYS
----------
Positive Implications:
-----------------------
1. It must be noted that FFC promotes cooperative federalism along with (rather than instead of) competitive federalism. This is so because all grants are not unconditional. States' performance for availing performance grants will be a crucial factor. So, FFC transfers are not only progressive but also ask the states to compete with the Centre to attract investment, garner capital and technology for their benefit
2. With greater fiscal space, states can meaningfully contribute to the overall growth and development in their regions, thereby adding to the aggregate growth of the nation
3. States will now have the flexibility to implement delinked CSS schemes as per local needs. This should ideally ensure efficient utilisation of government resources

Negative Implications:
-----------------------
1. In the near term, huge tax devolution could put some strain on Centre’s finances, especially until major CSS schemes get delinked and GST is implemented. So GST implementation indirectly helped to take the heat off the center's finances. also, if the centter were to implement the 7th pay commission, it would increase strain on center's finances.
2. With greater discretionary funds with States, there is a risk of wastage of funds by some states towards populist and non-productive ends. ( Yogi Adithyanath - Farmer's loan waiver - Huge loss on state's capital expenditure part )
